Q2:
The port number the client uses is 58830

Q3:
The client needs a port in order to know which server it wants to talk to

Q4:
Frame  Time    Source      Destination   Protocol  Length  Info
4  	0.110193209	129.6.15.29	192.168.133.128	  DAYTIME 	105	 DAYTIME Response

Q5:
60202 23-09-15 03:44:44 50 0 0 471.0 UTC(NIST) * 
Most of the contents of the frame are the day, month, year, minute, hour, second but also has the time zone which references NIST which is where we got the ip address from earlier 

Q6:
[SYN] means a synchronization packet which requests to talk to a server

Q7:
[ACK] means an acknowledgement packet means it received the request

Q8:
[FIN] means it is closing off the connection

Q9:
The daytime server initiated the closing since it just sent over the daytime response and in frame 5 we see the server send the [FIN] packet to the client

===== HTTP =====

1	   0.000000000	192.168.133.128	45.79.89.123	  TCP      	74	    56902 → 80 [SYN] Seq=0 Win=64240 Len=0 MSS=1460 SACK_PERM TSval=2505337845 TSecr=0 WS=128

The were two connections that were opened and we can tell because the first four frames are establishing that 3-way handshake, one of the connections was from port 56902 to port 80 and the other was from port 56908 to port 80

Q2:
Frame  Time        Source        Destination   Protocol  Length  Info
7	    0.117146669	192.168.133.128	45.79.89.123	HTTP	    408	   GET /index.html HTTP/1.1 
Here we see the protocol is HTTP and the info section a GET request which is asking for the html of the index page

Q3:
Frame  Time        Source        Destination   Protocol  Length  Info
11	  3.713305988	 192.168.133.128	45.79.89.123	HTTP	  377	  GET /jeff_square_head.jpg HTTP/1.1 
Here we see the protocol is HTTP and the info section the GET request which is asking for the photograph

===== QUESTIONS =====
I saw a [PSH] packet in the later frames of the HTTP segment, I wonder what that could mean and I saw it was with an ACK packet
Messing around with the frame details I saw epoch time which was like a billion seconds so I wonder what kind of time stamp that represents
