Spoofing:
  - An attacker could try to make a similar webpage that looks like our Tapirs Unlimited one that uses a very similar URL. If a user then goes to this page mistakingly, the attacker could get access to any sensitive information that user put in, for example, if there was a login popup and the user put their information in there, the attacker would then have their credentials. A corresponding mitigation for this scenario and the one below could be to require two-factor authentification.
  - Closely related, website spoofing could start with phishing attacks. An attacker could create in a phishing email for example, that imitates the legit Tapirs Unlimited and provide a link to a spoofed website. Corresponding mitigation again could be using two-factor authentification

Tampering:
  - Since Tapirs Unlimited will have features such as creating posts by users that get sent to the web server, attackers may take advantage of this by intercepting this communication from the client to the web server and being able to edit the original post and put something unwanted by the original user. Corresponding mitigation could be to use HTTPS for all the interactions.
  - Building off the spoofing attack, if an attacker has the login credentials of a user, they then would also have to ability to delete or create posts maliciously. Corresponding mitigation could be to use two-factor authentification.
