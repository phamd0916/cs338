How the code works is by using the equation A = g^a mod p and we know that g = 7, p = 61, and A = 30,
it runs through iterations of possible a values that satisfy this equation and the first number that 
satisfies it. It does the same for B = g^b mod p with B = 17 and the values we get from this are a = 41
and b = 23. To check that these two values work is by using these two equations: K = B^a mod p and K = A^b mod p
and by using the values we got, if both K's are the same then we have the key.
