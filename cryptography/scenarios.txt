1.
Alice and Bob use Diffie-Hellman to agree on a shared secret key K and then use symmetric encryption algorithm AES(K,M) to encrypt it and AES_D(K,C) to decrypt it. This works since AITM is not possible, which is the only downfall of Diffie-Hellman, and with AES the message is encrypted so Eve cannot read it.

2.
First, Alice would want to use a cryptographic hash funciton to create a hash of her message (H(M)). This makes it so Mal cannot modify the message without Bob being able to detect it since even slightly changing one character in the message would completely change H(M). Then, Alice is going to use her private key to give H(M) a digital signature and to ensure the message has not been tampered with. Finally Alice can send H(M) to Bob with the digital signature

First, since we know that AITM is impossible, Alice and Bob would use Diffie-Hellman to agree on a shared secret key K
Use Diffie-Hellman key exchange for secure key establishment.
Generate a symmetric key for the session.
Encrypt the contract using the symmetric key.
Use a cryptographic hash function to create a hash of the encrypted contract.
Sign the hash using Alice's private key to create a digital signature.
Send the encrypted contract along with the digital signature to Bob.
